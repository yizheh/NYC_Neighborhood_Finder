## Dashboard page 
- Give an overview of historical NYC rental and crime statistics. 
- For the rental market, we plotted the monthly average rental price from 2020-01 to 2021-08, which will help our users better understand rent fluctuations and make wiser financial decisions. 
- For crime statistics, we displayed the percentages that each crime level and age group takes up in all crime events from 2010-01 to 2021-08.

## Borough Information page
- Allow users to see average rent and crime count information for each borough for a selected year. 
- Year options for the user to choose from range from 2010 to 2020. Data is presented in both tabular and graphical formats. 
- There is also a button that will take users to a separate Borough Trends page where they can select a borough and see rent and crime count trends over time, side-by-side.

## Filter page
- Allow users to filter neighborhoods that meet their financial and safety criteria. 
- With regard to financial filtering, users can provide the minimum and maximum they are willing to pay for an apartment and we will only return those neighborhoods whose average rent falls within that range, along with their average rent, minimum rent, maximum rent, and rent range.

##  Search page 
- Allow users to search for neighborhoods based on the neighborhood's name, ZIP codes, or borough. 
- The page returns all neighborhoods that match a user's search criteria as well as the ZIP codes inside those neighborhoods. 
- When a user clicks on a neighborhood, details such as the neighborhoodâ€™s crime and rental rankings compared to other neighborhoods in the borough and a line graph of crime and rental prices over time are displayed.
